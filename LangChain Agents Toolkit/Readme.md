# 🧠 LangChain Agents Toolkit

A LangChain-based multi-agent system that routes natural language queries to specialized agents for Python code execution or CSV data analysis. Powered by GPT-4 and GPT-4 Turbo LLMs, this system enables automated reasoning, code generation, and data insights through natural language input.

---

## 🚀 Features

- 🔁 **Agent Routing** – Determines the appropriate tool (Python or CSV agent) based on user input.
- 🐍 **Python Agent** – Executes dynamic code for tasks such as QR code generation or logic-based computations.
- 📊 **CSV Agent** – Answers questions about structured data in `episode_info.csv`.
- 🧠 **LLM Integration** – Uses GPT-4 and GPT-4 Turbo to interpret queries and carry out complex multi-step reasoning.
